# a sample skeleton project
# Meant to be copied whenever you create a new project

# After copying steps:
# 1. Rename NAME directory
# 2. Update setup.py
# 3. Rename tests/NAME-tests.py
# 4. run 'nosetests' from root to ensure it is working
# 5. start coding

# You execute commands(tests) on this directory instead of going inside

# NOTE: nose project has been abandoned
