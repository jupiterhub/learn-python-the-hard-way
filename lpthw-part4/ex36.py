# Tips
# for if, always use an else
# if it doesn't make sense, make it die to easily debug
# never nest more than 2 if
# put blank lines before if-elif-else
# complex conditions should be moved to variable or method

# Write your own game similar to ex35.py
## Before coding draw a map (look at flow in ex35)
## list the tasks
## work on Easiest
## test your scripts often
